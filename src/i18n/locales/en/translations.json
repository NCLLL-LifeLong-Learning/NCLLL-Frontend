  "Cambodia's strong economic growth, averaging 7.7% GDP increase over the past two decades, is threatened by a mismatch between education outputs and labor market needs, with 60% of employers struggling to find skilled workers. With 62.% of Cambodia lacking basic digital skills, enhancing digital literacy and lifelong learning is crucial for workforce participation and income growth, as additional education can increase earnings by 5-15%. The ILC emphasizes the importance of lifelong learning and the need for national lifelong learning for skill relevance, career development, and equity. To address these challenges, the National Commission of Lifelong Learning is hosting a forum to improve skills, promote social mobility, and foster collaboration among government, employers, workers, and training institutions.": "Cambodia's strong economic growth, averaging 7.7% GDP increase over the past two decades, is threatened by a mismatch between education outputs and labor market needs, with 60% of employers struggling to find skilled workers.
